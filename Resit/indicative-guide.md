## Indicative marking guide

The list below aims to provide an indication of the kinds of features required for each marking boundary.
The final grade awarded will depend upon the exact combination and features and how well they have been implemented.
If you skip some features in lower bands, but implement others in higher bands, marking will take the overall achievement profile into account
If you want to be certain of achieving a grade within a particular band, the safest thing to do is to implement all the features in the preceding bands !

**In order to get pass mark (40) you must implement ALL of**:
- OBJ geometry file loading
- Wireframe rendering
- Keyboard control of camera position

**To get somewhere in the 40s you must ALSO implement SOME of**
- OBJ material file loading
- Flat shaded triangle rasterising
- Simple animation (e.g. fly-through, simple translation of model elements etc.)

**To get into 50s you must ALSO implement SOME of**
- Naive (non-perspective corrected) texture mapping
- Changing camera orientation (using orientation matrix)
- Hard Shadow with Ambient lighting

**To get into 60s you must ALSO implement SOME of**
- LookAt
- Diffuse lighting (proximity and angle-of-incidence)
- Gouraud shading
- More complex and sophisticated animation (e.g. articulation or multi-waypoint camera tracking)

**To get into 70s you must ALSO implement SOME of**
- Specular lighting
- Soft shadows
- Phong Shading
- Reflective Materials (e.g. mirrors. metal etc)
- Perspective corrected texture mapping for rasteriser (raytracing is too easy ;o)

**To get 80 and above you must ALSO implement SOME of**
- Bump maps
- Environment maps (for use with reflective materials)
- Refractive materials (e.g. glass)
- Photon maps and caustics
